# find_best_match
An open source Python project to consume a set of candidates (each consisting of a list of attributes with an associated
score for each attribute) and match them against a comparator (a list of attributes with an associated weight).
Return a list of the best match(es), as defined by the lowest difference score (a sum of the difference scores of all
the attributes). Examples below may clarify this!
